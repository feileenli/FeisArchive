            <p id="article-1">
                    The first time I broke up with someone, I was 21. It was the Spring of my junior year. I remember the smattering of cherry blossoms in the sky and the subtle smell of rain showers in the air. My first breakup was a friend breakup. She was my roommate, but perhaps more accurately, one of my closest and dearest college friends. 
                    <br><br>
                    To this day, I’m still not entirely sure what happened. The breakup was the product of months of poor communication, budding resentment, and everything in the space between love and hate. It was somehow also the product of one tragic and entirely avoidable disaster. I vaguely remember sitting in the living room with her, heart beating a dangerous staccato against my chest as she explained to me why we couldn’t be friends anymore. 
                    <br><br>
                    When she finished, I immediately rushed to apologize, <i>“I’m sorry, I didn’t realize I hurt you. I didn’t mean to.”</i> I remember my voice shaking, hands trembling with a fear I never experienced before. This was a friendship I couldn’t lose—in fact, even in that very moment, I couldn’t fathom actually losing her. I can’t recall the exact day, but there was a time sophomore year that I looked at her and felt deeply in my bones that she would be in my entourage of future bridesmaids. I clung on to that image even as confusion, frustration, and hurt filled my lungs as I scrambled to figure out the right thing to say. Surely, I would land on the perfect words that would save our friendship. Surely, she would realize that I was hurting as much as she was and that this was an obstacle for us to overcome, not crumble under. Except, this wasn’t some award winning coming-of-age story and the reality was that after months and months of quiet hurt, the relationship was unsalvageable. 
                    <br><br>
                    The following weeks were devastating and turned into a long overdue lesson on what a heartbreak was. By the end of the second week, I finished crafting a gut-spilling letter that I had rewritten nearly nine times and cried over at least fifty more. The tear ducts in my eyes were dry by the time I set the letter on her desk with a bouquet of yellow lilies and something like hope tucked into its leaves. 
                    <br><br>
                    <i>“Thanks, but this came too late.”</i>
                    <br><br>
                    For almost half a year after that letter, a small, wretched part of me still held out hope that she’d come around. She never did. 
                    <br><br>
                    I felt like some sort of psychotic-ex in that half a year. I’d run into her in the kitchen and my chest would grow tight with tension, anxiety, <i>hope</i>, and then she’d walk past me as if I were a ghost and the tightness would unravel, painfully, inch by inch. Some days were better. There was this one time that I caught her coming back from Garba, all dressed up, decked in gorgeous pinks and greens and glittering sequins. “You look pretty,” I said honestly. The smile that graced her face must’ve been instinctual because it was so raw and genuine that I felt like I had time traveled back to when we were still friends. 
                    <br><br>
                    The next day, I returned to being a ghost. 
                    <br><br>
                    It’s strange, skin-crawling almost, how easily you can go from sharing your pains and joys with someone to complete and utter silence. I felt crazy, was the friendship only important to me? I wanted to think that it meant more to her, but the speed and ease with which she walked away said otherwise. I’ve always been someone who’s a bit too quick to forgive, so her unwillingness to do it for me was all the more painful. In my eyes, the conflict in question wasn’t something I’d ever end a close friendship for. I truly felt that if anything, it was a chance to bring us closer together. The idea that maybe she never viewed the friendship to be as close as I did hurt me more than anything else. 
                    <br><br>
                    I knew it wasn’t right to try to assign reason to her actions. After all, every thought I had was a mere conjecture, an assumption predicated on only what I could see and heavily influenced by what I felt. Still, I spent months trying to rationalize the breakup. I knew I fucked up, that I made a mistake, but it was one that I believed was born from a mixture of miscommunication, stress, an unhealthy childhood that resulted in unhealthy habits that I am still trying to unlearn, and a million other things. But of those million other things, none of them even came close to a desire to hurt her. So I told myself that maybe she was dealing with something, maybe someone said something to her, maybe this, maybe that. I hated the feeling of rejection, so I desperately crafted reasons for projection in her. Hurt people hurt people, I reminded myself. Except, I wasn’t sure if I was talking about her or me. In retrospect, it was probably both of us. 
                    <br><br>
                    There was this sad little voice in the back of my head that kept repeating, if the love and the care and the intention is there, why can’t this work? It was a stupid, futile thought, but like a mantra, it wouldn’t stop. At night, I’d close my eyes and reach down to wear her shoes but even then, I couldn’t understand. Yes, the hurt, pain, and betrayal she felt made sense, but surely if she took a moment to step in my shoes, she’d see the same whirlwind of emotions swirling in my chest. Why couldn't she see that we were two sides of the same coin? I wanted so badly to crack open her head and peer inside, as if all the answers would be laid bare in the soft tissue of her brain. 
                    <br><br>
                    Hurt people, hurt people, I repeated quietly. 
                    <br><br>
                    A few of my friends grew indignant on my behalf. I appreciated it because underneath the flowers and the letter and the desperate desire to do right by her, a part of me was simmering with anger and resentment. Occasionally, it’d boil over and I’d find myself drowning in these horrible urges. These urges to confront her, to shout and yell at her, to hear her apologize and confess that she was as distraught and regretful as I was. But what was the point of that? After all, these terrible feelings were a result of how much I cared for her, how much I cherished her. I was angry and bitter and sad <i>because</i> she meant so much to me. In what world would it make sense then, to direct these negative feelings towards her when they were simply a product of all my positive feelings for her? 
                    <br><br>
                    Hurt people, hurt people, I reminded myself. 
                    <br><br>
                    So I threw myself into happier things. I spent my summer working, crying at Broadway shows, playing badminton, learning new recipes, and building old and new friendships. I loved myself and those around me deeply and as a result, I became a happier, more joyful human being. I wasn’t letting go, necessarily. A part of me was&mdash;and still is&mdash;angry and hurt, but as I let myself cry more and laugh more, it became easier to live with it. Slowly, as summer turned into fall, I could feel myself begin to move on. 
                    <br><br>
                    It’s funny. Everybody yearns for closure, but the truth is, closure doesn’t always exist. There isn’t always a perfect black bow to tie things up neatly. There isn’t always a final conversation that answers every question, clarifies every ambiguity, and kisses every wound closed. Sometimes, the closure is the absence, the silence, and the evergrowing list of things unsaid. Sometimes, closure is simply learning to live with the heartbreak, the pain, and most importantly, the love that started it all.

            </div>
            <p id="article-2">
                “Don’t worry about me, have fun” Jonathan said, with a small shake of his head. He looked at us, with this tiny smile on his face that said “I’m fine, seriously,” and I looked at Ishanvi, torn. We were standing in line for Monroe, the “intern bar” of San Francisco. It was August, so the night was warm, and the streets were full of flickering lights and bustling crowds. Seconds ago, the bouncer had tapped Jonathan on the shoulder and pulled him out of line for violating the dress code.
                <br><br>
                “There’s an intern party in Palo Alto, I’ll go there,” Jonathan said, already calling an uber. 
                <br><br>
                “Are you sure?” I said, trying and failing to conceal my desire to stay at Monroe. 
                <br><br>
                Jonathan just smiled, unfailingly kind as always, and said “I’m sure, I’m sure, we can hang out again later.” And then, he was gone. 
                <br><br> 
                It’s when I’m standing in the church, his casket covered in flowers, wrapped in the echoes of hymns and prayers that I think about how lonely that ride to Palo Alto must’ve been. 
                <br><br>
                Monroe was one of the last times I saw him. The memory has faded since—I can barely recall what he was wearing, what he looked like, what he said, but I know it happened. He might’ve told me to just shut up and go into the bar, he might’ve been wearing a button down, he might’ve had twists in his hair or a new silver nose ring. Or maybe he got the nose ring after that night. I can’t remember. What I do remember is seeing him one last time that summer, in his apartment, where he was hosting a barbeque party for his intern cohort. I remember seeing him surrounded by his newly made friends, something confident and warm in his energy, and thinking, wow, he’s grown so much since high school. 
                <br><br>
                Jonathan is—was an enigma, in high school and even more so in college. He was stupidly smart and it was the kind of smart that you couldn’t help but admire. More importantly, though, he was unfailingly kind, always happy and willing to help, and he never ever made you feel stupid for needing it. He might’ve joked about it, with that sharp sarcastic humour of his, but there was just something about him—perhaps his sincere eagerness to help or his genuine desire to see you succeed—that made it all okay. I was never that close to him, but we and the 120 other kids in our high school program spent four years struggling through chemistry, calculus, quarantine, IB exam prep, and college apps together. Whenever he’d come to UMD, I would try to say hi, and through these sparse encounters, we would witness each other grow into our young and foolish 20 year old selves. 
                <br><br>
                In the corner of my friend’s apartment in San Francisco, face warm from cheap alcohol and the presence of old and new friends, I told Jonathan that I would visit Columbia soon. That I would come say hi. I wonder if he knew then that we would never see each other again. 
                <br><br>
                The day I found out, I was sitting in the corner of a library, face covered in tears, head swimming from the pain and force of it all, on a call with Ishanvi, confused, helpless, and terrified for her. She was my closest friend from high school and one of his closest friends. I often think about how his loss to her would be like if I woke up one day only to discover that she was gone. She told me that she had spoken to him a few weeks ago, that he had said he was feeling a bit lonely, a bit sad, but doing better than before. I wanted to hold her, scoop up her tears and quiet sobs as if somehow, I could carry the weight of her grief and guilt in my hands, but she was in Portugal, studying abroad thousands of miles away. The next time I would see her, and many others from high school, would be at his funeral.
                <br><br>
                At first, I didn’t know how to mourn someone I wasn’t that close to, but who still lived vividly in my memories. I didn’t know what to do with this sudden, overwhelming grief—for him and for all those who knew him. I didn’t know how to carry a loss that wasn’t fully mine, but still pressed down on me like it was. 
                <br><br>
                His funeral was a beautiful thing in the wake of a tragedy. It feels wrong to say that, to look at something as sad and tragic as death and say, well, this beautiful thing happened, but it did. In the face of death, life converged. About 15 kids from our high school came. Some flew over from the West coast, some from Europe, some took a bus down, and some drove over. Ishanvi had immediately booked a flight home from Portugal. The last time I had seen her was in August, in San Francisco.   
                <br><br>
                I walked into the church, eyes immediately searching for her. I don’t remember if I said her name, but I walked up behind her, and sensing something, she turned around. She took one look at me and pulled me into a hug. I immediately hugged her back, something desperate in the curve of my arms. Everyone from high school sat together. We filled up the first two pews, shoulders brushing, wrapped in a painful sort of silence. Maria cried so hard she threw up. 
                <br><br>
                In her speech, his mom said that she had always wanted a boy, but every time, she had been blessed with a girl instead. It was after her third daughter that she gave up. Of course, it was only then that Jonathan arrived. 
                <br><br>
                Jonathan is derived from "Yehonatan" which translates to "Yahweh has given,” or "God has given.” 
                <br><br>
                Jonathan was a gift from God. 
                <br><br>
                I’ve never been the religious sort, but as I sat in that church, head bowed in silent prayer, I swear I could taste the divinity on my tongue. And maybe there was something divine in the air that day because when we walked back to my car, it started snowing. 
                <br><br>
                It was the first snow of the year. 
                <br><br>
                “What does this mean?” I asked with wonder, feeling the cold pinpricks of snowflakes melt against my cheek. I reached a hand into the air as if the answers were hanging somewhere above me, like ripe fruit waiting to be picked. 
                <br><br>
                Of all days for it to snow. How strange. 
                <br><br>
                “I don’t know,” Ishanvi replied, staring at the sky. I watched as the snow fell around her like ashes. 
                <br><br>
                After the ceremony, we all gathered around a long table, like the ones in the high school cafeteria, and ate. I hadn’t seen these people in years, but it felt as if no time had passed—it was like high school all over again. Jenny was the same as ever, elegant and composed and always quick to laugh; Rohan was a bit quieter, with long curls that now covered his eyes; Sebbie was different, funnier perhaps, in a way I couldn’t explain. I was never that close to these people in high school, and less so in college, but it hit me then, that there was just something about this group that allowed me to feel at ease, to feel comfortable in a way I never could be in college. I realized it later when I was back in my college apartment.  
                <br><br>
                It was home, they felt like home. 
                <br><br>
                After the funeral, I offered to drive Sebbie back. We lived near each other, but we were never close. Even so, there was nothing even remotely awkward about the 30 minute ride home. It was as if all barriers had been broken, crumbled under the shared weight of grief. Maybe it was a one-off thing, but I felt like the people we became in college, the people we were now, clicked instantly. I wondered why I didn't talk to him more. 
                <br><br> 
                I wondered why I didn’t talk to Jonathan more. 
                <br><br> 
                There was this period after the news where he constantly dogged my thoughts, and then at some point, life got busy, and I stopped thinking about him as much. The shift was terrifying. Sure, I was never that close to him, but he was a person, a friend, a brother, a son. Jonathan took up <i>space</i>. It felt wrong to wake up and not think about him, to go to bed and simply fall asleep. It felt wrong to stress over finals and interviews knowing that he must’ve been dealing with so much more. A whole person was gone, but the Earth kept spinning, uncaring of the grief that pushed it. 
                <br><br>
                And perhaps my fear was a selfish one. I can’t speak to what Jonathan was dealing with, but when I was much younger than I am now and sadder than a child should be, I often asked myself what was the meaning behind all of this. Not in an Artistolian sort of way. I just wanted—<i>needed</i> there to be a reason for all this pain, something worth continuing for. As the years passed, I somehow found my way out of that sad, lonely maze. 
                <br><br>
                I wonder, if I had looked back, would I have seen Jonathan?         
                <br><br>
                I was scared of what my ability to carry on meant. It felt like a confirmation of sorts—of all the thoughts that plagued me when I was a child. And then, for a short moment, a terrible thought struck me. That when Jonathan made the decision he did, perhaps he thought to himself that with time, his friends and family would move on, would heal. So it was okay. And with a force that rattled my bones, this sudden, overwhelming urge to prove him wrong washed over me. I had to prove him wrong, this boy that I once had physics and math class with, that I saw maybe four times in the past two years. I knew the people closest to him would never truly move on, but <i>I</i> had to prove him wrong. For who, I’m not sure. Maybe for younger me. Maybe for older me. Maybe for him.    
                <br><br>       
                That night, I went through all my photos and searched for ones with him in it. I made an album. I tucked his photo into my wallet. I didn’t have much and it hit me then that this was all I had of him, that this was all I would <i>ever</i> have of him. My heart twisted with horrible, futile desire. I wished I had more photos. I wished I had more memories. I wished I knew him better. But more than anything, I wished that when I saw him in California, I had given him a hug. Not one of those casual half-body ones or those brief shoulder ones you do when you say goodbye.                
                <br><br>
                No, I wished I had held him in my arms, for a long, comforting moment. 
                <br><br>
                I was never that close to Jonathan, but what does it matter? Our lives are ephemeral and short, but they hold space on this Earth in the form of physics classes, math homework, brief hellos, and stupid stupid dress codes. If you look in the album, there’s this one video of us and some friends driving to Philadelphia our senior year of high school. You can barely see Jonathan because he’s in the front, driving, but the entire car is singing Rasputin, our young, teenage voices, loud, rambunctious and so full of life.
